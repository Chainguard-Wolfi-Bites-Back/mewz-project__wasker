# An Example of Running Wasker Output Based on Rust Std

Similar to the [Linux WASI wrapper](../c/wasi-wrapper-linux.c),
4 mock WASI interfaces are implemented in order to support [the rust example](../../rust/README.md).  

## Prerequisite

Have Wasker installed.

## Run the example

Just run. Check build options in [`build.rs`](./build.rs).

```shell
cargo run
```
